# Professional services

## Introduction

As already explained, Castor is an open-source product. This means that the
source code is available at no charge and may be obtained from [github](http://github.com/castor-data-binding)
using git. Due to the *open source* nature of the project, there is no guaranteed level of
support (*of commercial quality*) offered by the project and its
community.
      
Still, there are a growing number of third party individuals/companies
providing such support in the form of *professional services*.
This page provides you with a directory of individuals/companies
offering commercial services related to individual or all areas
of Castor.
      
We hope that the information provided is of value to you, our users,
and the individuals/companies displayed below will be more than happy
to discuss any suggestions/recommendations related to this offerings.

# Individuals/Companies and their commercial offerings

## Companies
            
### CODA: Financial Intelligence (http://www.coda.com/)

Contact: Andrew Fawcett (andrew.fawcett@coda.com)

As a developer of international financial management and
procurement systems, CODA started a project to XML-enable our Financials
application server," noted Andrew Fawcett of CODA. "We made two major
technology decisions. The first was to use the W3C XML Schema to
describe our XML messages. The second was to facilitate the use of an
XML Data Binding framework. This allows our developers to process XML
messages in a more productive and intuitive way within their programs,
without requiring extensive training and experience with XML or its
traditional APIs such as SAX or DOM. In performing an analysis of XML
Data Binding frameworks, we found that Castor was the only
implementation at the time that met our needs in terms of its support
for W3C XML Schema and its ability to integrate with our Web
infrastructure.

In addition, we use Castor internally within our
Web client-enabling framework (based on the Java Servlet API). Java
source code produced by the Castor source code generator is used to
dynamically bind data to our Web forms. The resulting data can then be
marshaled directly between our Web applications and application server."
