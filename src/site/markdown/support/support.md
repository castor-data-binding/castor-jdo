# Castor support

## Introduction
      
Castor JDO is an open-source product. This means that the source code is
available at no charge and may be obtained from [Github](http://github.com/castor-data-binding/castor-jdo)
using git.
      
Since Castor JDO is freely available, including the source code, there is no
guaranteed level of support available. The online [documentation](#Documentation)
is the best place to start.
If you have trouble or have more advanced questions not available in the
online documentation, then please consider subscribing to one of the
various available [mailing lists](mailing-lists.html). In general, the lists 
are the best place to ask questions about the product.
      
Please note, though, that for problems of any kind, you should still use
one of the mailing list as your preferred way of communicating to us, as
this enables other users to browse through old email at one of the
available mailing list archives.

## Documentation      
      
The online documentation is available throughout the web site. To get
started simply click on the appropriate sections listed in the menu bar
located to the left side of this page.
      
If you can't find something in the documentation, try looking through
the examples (as shipped as part of the source distribution).
      
There are also numerous [presentations and
articles](../documentation/publications.html) available about Castor JDO to help get you started.

## Reporting Bugs and Bug Tracking

If you find a bug, please file a report at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/castor-data-binding/castor-jdo/issues).

## Commercial Support

Having said that, please note that there are a growing number of third
party individuals/companies providing such support, as detailed
[here](../support/professional-services.html).
